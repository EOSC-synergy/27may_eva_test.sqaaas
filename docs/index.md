# FAIR Evaluator
FAIR evaluator has been developed to check the FAIRness level of digital objects from different repositories or data portals. It requires the object identifier (preferably persistent and unique identifier) and the repository to check. It also provides a generic and agnostic way to check digital objects.

## Description
FAIR evaluator is a service that runs over the web. IT can be deployed as a stand-alone application or in a docker container. It implements different web services: the API that manages the evaluation and the web interface to facilitate accessing and user-friendliness.

## Goals
The goals of this service are:
- Checks data and metadata from a digital object
- Based on some indicators, evaluates the FAIRness of the resource.
- Provides feedback to the users to improve
