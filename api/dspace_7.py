        This indicator is linked to the following principle: R1.1: (Meta)data are released with a clear
        and accessible data usage license. More information about that principle can be found here.
    
        This indicator is about the way that the reuse licence is expressed. Rather than being a
        human-readable text, the licence should be expressed in such a way that it can be processed
        by machines, without human intervention, for example in automated searches.

        This indicator requires the metadata to include information about the provenance of the
        data, i.e. information about the origin, history or workflow that generated the data, in a
        way that is compliant with the standards that are used in the community in which the data
